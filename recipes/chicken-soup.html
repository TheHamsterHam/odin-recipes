            <em>Ingredients</em>
            <ul>
               <li>Whole chicken</li>
               <li>Carrots</li>
                <li>Stalks celery</li>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <li>Water to cover</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Steps:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place chicken, carrots, celery, and onion in a large soup pot; add enough cold water to cover. 
                Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, 
                until meat falls off of the bone, about 90 minutes. Skim off foam every so often, as needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove chicken from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle; chop meat into pieces, 
                and discard skin and bones
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strain out vegetables, reserving the stock; rinse the soup pot and return the stock to the pot.
                Chop vegetables into smaller pieces; return chopped chicken and vegetables to the pot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Warm soup until heated through; season with salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon to taste.   
                </li>
            </ol>
