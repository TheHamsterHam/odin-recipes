This file is a listing of what I learned so far about creating a basic website.
A simple website should include the boilerplate/template as listed:
1.<!DOCTYPE html>
2.<htlm lang="en">
3.  <head>
4.   <meta charset="UTF-8">
5.	<title></title>
6.  </head>
7.  <body>
8    <p></p> 
9   </body>
10.</html>

Note:
-There are 6 headings that can be add (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) to format with.
-if you would like to make a comment type <!--example -->, this will not show up on the 
webpage but can be read by other who looks at the code.
-to bold words or sentences type <strong></strong>, to italicize text type <em></em>.
-To add a image type <img scr="your image link here" alt="an alt is a description of your
image">.
-To create a link use <a href=""></a>, there are two type of links absolute and relative
links. Absolute links are links with protocol://domain/path, while relative links are 
created to link pages/images within your website.
